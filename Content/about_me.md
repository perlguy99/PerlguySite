# About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m Brent Danger Michalski. Yes, *Danger* is my legal middle name - it's a long story, so maybe we can talk about it sometime.  ðŸ¤“

I am a well-tenured, innovative iOS Developer with over 25 years of software engineering experience and more than 12 years dedicated to iOS development. I am passionate about iOS development and genuinely love what I do. 

Sharing knowledge and mentoring junior developers brings me great joy *sounds corny, but true*, and I strive to foster an innovative, collaborative and *fun* environment while creating high-performance, accessible, and easy-to-use apps that users love.

My *official* journey in tech started back in 1997, and since then, Iâ€™ve led numerous successful projects, including the development of the [GEOINT App Store](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/innovation-intelligence-story-geoint-app-store-brent-michalski-pbfhc/?trackingId=jH1eJ%2BESngstjay%2FRmkwew%3D%3D) for the U.S. Intelligence Community ([Wired: The DoDâ€™s App Store Does This One Crucial Thing to Stay Secure](https://www.wired.com/story/dod-app-store-does-this-one-crucial-thing-to-stay-secure/)) and the [Edward Jones](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edward-jones/id457043098) iOS app. I specialize in Swift, SwiftUI, and cutting-edge development methodologies like Test-Driven Development (TDD).

In addition to my technical skills, I bring a quirky sense of humor and a passion for continuous improvement. I believe that loving what you do transforms work into something you are happy to do every day. 

I have a deep love for learning and experimenting with new technologies, from AI, Augmented Reality and Machine Learning to 3D printing and IoT so when Iâ€™m not working on something related to iOS, you can find me tinkering with Raspberry Pi or exploring the latest advancements in tech.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
