## Turd Herder App Description

Yes, you read it correctly. I created a game called Turd Herder that, honestly, *everyone* who played it loved it and thought it was fun and funny. Turd Herder is a whimsical and entertaining augmented reality (AR) game that leverages Apple's ARKit to deliver a unique and amusing gaming experience. Inspired by a playful tutorial, Turd Herder transforms a simple concept into a fun and engaging game where players hunt for virtual poop emojis scattered around them in the real world. The objective is to locate and tap on these emojis as quickly as possible, making it a delightful challenge for players of all ages.

Despite its humorous theme, Turd Herder showcases advanced AR technology and thoughtful game design. Players can enjoy a variety of sound effects, including over 30 different fart sounds, and visually appealing graphics purchased specifically for the game. The game is designed to be family-friendly and has been tested with both adults and children, ensuring fun for everyone.

Unfortunately, due to Apple's content policies, the app faced multiple rejections, including a rebranding attempt as "Covid Killer," which also did not meet approval. However, the source code has now been released as open source, allowing other developers to learn from and enjoy this creative project.

Turd Herder stands as a testament to creative development and the ability to integrate advanced technology with a sense of humor, demonstrating both technical skill and playful imagination.
