#  Turd Herder

Yes, you read it correctly. I created a game called Turd Herder that, honestly, *everyone* who played it loved it and thought it was fun and funny. I spent a lot of time and money getting this app ready for Apple's App Store, only to be absolutely rejected with no chance of resolution...
I tried to re-brand it into "The Corona Killer" where you had to tap on viruses instead of poop emojis, but Apple wouldn't accept anything "corona virus related" either.  I finally just gave up and I have released it as open source. ðŸ™„
