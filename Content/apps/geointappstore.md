## GEOINT App Store Description

The GEOINT App Store was truly a pioneering, and highly innovative project and solution for its time, sadly, as of August 27th, 2021, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) closed the Innovative GEOINT Application Provider Program (IGAPP), and the GEOINT App Store is no longer providing access to commercial apps. *Working on the GEOINT App Store, represents a defining moment in my professional career. It also is tough to use as an example of your work because you can’t show it to anyone.*

The GEOINT App Store is a pioneering platform designed to provide secure, mission-critical applications to the U.S. Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense (DoD). Developed by NJVC in partnership with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the app store offers a secure and resilient environment for distributing both government-funded and commercial applications tailored to the unique needs of military and intelligence personnel.

The GEOINT App Store was conceived to replicate the usability and convenience of commercial app stores like Google Play and Apple’s App Store while maintaining the highest standards of security required for government operations. The platform is accessible to all members of the DoD and intelligence community who possess a Common Access Card (CAC), ensuring that sensitive and mission-critical information can be quickly and securely disseminated.

## Key Features:

1. **Secure Distribution**:
   - Ultrafast and secure delivery of apps to authorized users.
   - Rigorous security screening processes for all applications to prevent malware and unauthorized access.

2. **User Accessibility**:
   - Available to over 5 million active CAC users, including DoD personnel and select foreign partners.
   - Apps are accessible based on the user’s level of clearance and specific needs.

3. **Wide Range of Applications**:
   - Includes over 130 applications covering various mission areas such as aviation, maritime, land, disaster response, and science.
   - Apps include geospatial mapping tools, real-time weather tracking, military ranking reference tools, and more.

4. **Innovative Features**:
   - Subscription management, app launch tracking, and enhanced security measures including a "kill switch" for unauthorized apps.
   - Segmented access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access certain apps.

5. **Developer Engagement**:
   - Encourages collaboration with commercial developers by providing tools and support to meet stringent security requirements.
   - The Innovative GEOINT Application Provider Program (IGAPP) streamlines the app submission process for commercial vendors.

6. **Performance and Usability**:
   - Fourfold performance improvement through efficient coding practices and the use of modern programming languages.
   - Intuitive user interface designed for ease of use, similar to commercial app stores.
