## Project Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Lead iOS Developer & SDK Architect |
| **Team Size** | 8-12 developers |
| **Duration** | 3+ years |
| **Impact** | 5+ million authorized users across DoD and Intelligence Community |

---

## The Challenge

The U.S. Intelligence Community and Department of Defense needed a secure, enterprise-grade app distribution platform that could deliver mission-critical applications to field personnel while maintaining the highest security standards. Traditional app store models weren't designed for classified environments with CAC authentication requirements.

---

## My Contributions

**Technical Leadership:**
- Architected and developed the iOS client application and custom SDK
- Led the Swift migration from legacy Objective-C codebase
- Designed the REST API integration layer for app distribution and tracking
- Implemented secure authentication using CAC/PIV credentials

**Key Achievements:**
- **4x performance improvement** through efficient coding practices and modern Swift patterns
- Built custom SDK enabling third-party developers to integrate security features
- Developed "kill switch" functionality for remote app revocation
- Created segmented access controls based on clearance levels

## Technologies Used

| Category | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Languages** | Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, Private Cloud |
| **Backend** | REST APIs, SQL, NoSQL |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD |
| **Security** | PKI, CAC/PIV, Encryption, Vulnerability Scanning |

## The Outcome

The GEOINT App Store became the primary distribution platform for geospatial intelligence applications across the DoD and Intelligence Community. The platform served over 130 applications to millions of authorized users until its sunset in August 2021.

> *Working on the GEOINT App Store represents a defining moment in my professional career. It demonstrated how enterprise-grade mobile solutions could serve mission-critical government needs while maintaining commercial app store usability.*
