## Project Overview

| **Team Size** | 1 (personal project) |
| **Duration** | 3 months |
| **Platform** | iOS 17+, Universal (iPhone & iPad) |

## The Problem

We've all been there—scrolling through Photos looking for that one vacation picture, only to wade through hundreds of reaction images, meme templates, and screenshots. The Photos app wasn't designed for meme collections, and existing solutions either lack features or compromise privacy.

---

## The Solution

**MemeCommander** provides a dedicated home for your meme collection with:

- **Bulk Import**: Move thousands of memes from Photos with just a few taps
- **Custom Tagging**: Create unlimited categories that match how *you* think about memes
- **Lightning-Fast Search**: Find any meme instantly by tags, dates, or combinations
- **Full Backup/Restore**: Export your entire library with tags intact

---

## Technical Highlights

**Modern SwiftUI Architecture:**
- Built entirely with SwiftUI for iOS 17+
- @Observable macro for clean state management
- Async/await throughout for responsive UI

**Performance Engineering:**
- Efficient bulk import handling thousands of images
- Optimized thumbnail generation and caching
- Lazy loading for smooth scrolling through large collections

**StoreKit 2 Integration:**
- In-app purchases for Pro features
- Lifetime unlock option ($4.99)
- Graceful handling of purchase flows and restoration

## Technologies Used

| Category | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Language** | Swift |
| **UI Framework** | SwiftUI, PhotosUI |
| **Data** | SwiftData / Core Data |
| **Purchases** | StoreKit 2 |
| **File Management** | FileManager, ZIP compression |

---

## Key Accomplishments

1. **End-to-End Product Development**: Took an idea from concept to App Store release as a solo developer
2. **User-Centric Design**: Built features based on real pain points from managing my own 5,000+ meme collection
3. **Privacy-First**: No data collection, no analytics—your memes stay on your device
4. **Quality Engineering**: Comprehensive testing and performance optimization before launch
