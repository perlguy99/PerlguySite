They called us the Four Musketeers, and we were brought in to rescue a project that was only five weeks from deadline, but months from completion. Despite one member proving inadequate and dropping out, we got the project done essentially on time, surpassing expectations.<br /><br />That is the competitive setting to keep in mind when I say that I was astonished with how skilled Brent is. It's the first time in over a decade that I felt like I had someone I wanted to be like, instead of feeling I am the role model for others on a given project. His ability to absorb and refactor an entire code base is beyond what I realized people could do, an ability worth striving to emulate.<br /><br />He also has unusually good character, and more people skill than most techies, which is a huge advantage in the development world, helping facilitate the communication necessary to get multi-member projects coordinated and done well.",
