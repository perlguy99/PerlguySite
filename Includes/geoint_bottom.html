Launched in the early 2010s, the GEOINT App Store catered to the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense, first responders and the Intelligence Community, offering over 130 applications across various classification levels. These applications, many developed commercially through the Innovative GEOINT Application Provider Program (IGAPP), were designed to meet the unique and sensitive needs of our users.

Our security measures set a new standard for digital platforms. We implemented rigorous screening processes, in-depth source code reviews, and maintained a controlled environment to thwart malware threatsâ€”critical for the protection of sensitive information.

My role was central to the project. I led the mobile development team and undertook a comprehensive rewrite of the iOS GEOINT App Store, transitioning it from Objective-C to Swift. I designed and wrote the essential Swift Developer SDK and architected the API used across all platforms, significantly enhancing performance and ensuring smooth adaptability to ongoing mobile platform updates.

This endeavor not only secured a reliable distribution channel for mission-critical apps but also established the GEOINT App Store as a trailblazer in government technology solutions. Although the store closed in 2021, the project remains a highlight of my career, showcasing my capability to navigate and innovate within highly regulated environments.

I really wish I'd been able to showcase the GEOINT App Store to the general public because it truly was work that I am still very proud of.
