The GEOINT App Store was truly a pioneering, and highly innovative project and solution for its time, sadly, as of August 27th, 2021, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) closed the Innovative GEOINT Application Provider Program (IGAPP), and the GEOINT App Store is no longer providing access to commercial apps.

Working on the GEOINT App Store, represents a defining moment in my professional career. It also is tough to use as an example of your work because you can’t show it to anyone.

<i>The GEOINT App Store wasn't just an "Enterprise App Store", it had all of the capabilities of Apple's App Store, and more!</i>

<h3>Further capabilities of the GEOInt App Store:</h3>
<ul>
 <li> <b>Subscription Service</b> - Specify a time period for when your app can be used. Users can renew subscriptions in-app.
 <li> <b>Usage Management</b> - Allows admins of GEOINT App Store to remotely lock down an application for a specific user, app, version, etc.
 <li> <b>Metrics</b> - Enables GEOINT App Store admins to have metrics on app usage, including time and location data.
 <li> <b>Device ID</b> - Provides access to a device ID that will match the device ID that the native GEOINT App Store app uses.
 <li> <b>Login ID</b> - Provides access to a login ID that is assigned to a user, regardless of device.
 <li> <b>In-App Reviews</b> - Allows users to write a review for your product from within the app. This review will be posted in the GEOINT App Store.
 <li> <b>Provisioning Profile Check</b> - Monitors for provisioning profile expiration and alerts the user when the certificate used to sign your app is about to expire.
